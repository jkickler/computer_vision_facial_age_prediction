# Facial age prediction - a SML regression problem

# 1. Description
- The project focuses on a supervised machine learning regression problem. 
- The goal of the project is to predict the age of a person based on a face image.
- The [*facial age*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frabbisw/facial-age) dataset from Kaggle was used, which consists of 99 folders. Each folder represents the age of the faces contained within it and was generated from WIKI_ART.
- Several CNNs where trained, evaluated and hypertuned.

# 2. Running the code
- The complete code is split up in 6 jupyter notebooks.
- As deep learning framework TensorFlow with the Keras API was used.
- The project was constructed with Google Colab, which is recommended to use for running the notebooks.
