To compare two images using ahash, their hash values are calculated and the hamming distance between them is measured (i.e. the number of bit positions where the two hash values differ). If the hamming distance is below a certain threshold, the two images are considered similar.

While techniques such as data augmentation or re-weighting could potentially improve the representation of this group, they can also introduce biases if not applied carefully. For instance, data augmentation may result in the over-representation of certain characteristics or features present in the original data. Similarly, re-weighting can lead to overfitting and poor generalization if too much importance is given to a small number of samples.\n","\n","The most effective solution to address this issue would be to add more images of Black individuals to each age group in our dataset. However, due to time constraints for delivering the project, we have decided to acknowledge the underrepresentation of Black individuals in our dataset and accept that this may result in a model that does not generalize well to new images of Black individuals.\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"gpuClass":"standard","kernelspec":{"display_name":"tf","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.16"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
